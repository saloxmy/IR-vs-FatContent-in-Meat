# Establishing a predictive model for Fat Content in meat using Infared Absorbance 

Traditional analytical chemistry methods are used to accurately measure the fat content in foods. However, these can be expensive and sometimes overkill in cases like routine quality control, educational settings, and other non-critical applications. 

The *Theory of IR Spectroscopy* proposes that unique molecular structures absorb frequencies of light differently. We exploit this by establishing a predictive relationship between the IR spectrum and fat content using a [dataset of meat samples measured by Tecator](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/modeldata/html/meats.html)

The dataset is explained further by the following permission note: "For each meat sample the data consists of a 100 channel spectrum of absorbances and the contents of moisture (water), fat and protein. The absorbance is -log10 of the transmittance measured by the spectrometer. The three contents, measured in percent, are determined by analytic chemistry."([Tecator](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/modeldata/html/meats.html))
